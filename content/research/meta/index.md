## 💻 Algorithm enhances efficiency

Combining self-learning algorithm with shadow tomography, we propose SLST protocol, which enhances the efficiency in the reconstruction of multiphoton states, including using fewer measurements, having higher accuracy. In addition, by introducing calibration, we observe SLST improves the robustness against experimental imperfections.
