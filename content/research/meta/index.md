## 🎥 3D animation

I have made a 3d animation to clearly demonstrate the experimental setup:

Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your `assets/media/` media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

## 💻 Algorithm enhances efficiency

Combining self-learning algorithm with shadow tomography, we propose SLST protocol, which enhances the efficiency in the reconstruction of multiphoton states, including using fewer measurements, having higher accuracy. In addition, by introducing calibration, we observe SLST improves the robustness against experimental imperfections.

## ⚙️ Metasurface enables this algorithm

Metasurface could realize octahedron POVM, enabling the efficient algorithm mentioned before.
