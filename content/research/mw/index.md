title: Microwave discharge of metal enhanced by micro-nano structures on surface  
summary: The microwave-induced discharge process and associated high-energy-site effect can be optimized in a controlled manner through surface design, since the discharge is fundamentally related to the field emission of electrons from the initiator.

I started this research from my second-year undergraduate study in weekends and vacations. The result is presented in the published paper **_Frontiers_ _in_ _Energy_**Â 16, 931â€“942 (2022). This paper contains two main parts: microwave-SiC discharge and microwave-metal discharge, and I complete the experiment and data analysis of the second part.
