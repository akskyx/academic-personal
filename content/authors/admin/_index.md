    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Welcome! I am a master graduted from Shandong University (Jinan, China), specializing in quantum optics. My main research involves using novel optical device and designing corresponding algorithm to improve the efficiency of characterizing photonic states. All studies can be found in "Research" section. I am recently looking for PhD position in optics and imaging.
